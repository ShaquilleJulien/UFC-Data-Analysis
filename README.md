# UFC-Data-Analysis
The project was centered around data from the UFC from 1993 to 2021. I'll be carrying out Exploratory Data Analysis to answer key questions and gather some insights. 

# Key Questions 
- Compare performance metrics (strikees, takedowns, etc.) between red and blue figters?
- Does the presence of a prtticular refree affect the number of submissions or knockouts in matches?
- How does a fighterâ€™s stance (orthodox, southpaw, etc.) affect their performance metrics and win rate?!
- How does the average significant strike accuracy (B_avg_SIG_STR_pct) compare across different weight classes?
- Are there noticeable differences in average takedown accuracy (B_avg_TD_pct) between weight classes?!

# Tools 
- Pandas 
- Numpy 
- Seaborn 
- Matplotlib
- Scipy

# Data Used
- The data set used contains names of fighters and diffrent performance matrics and statistics.

# Analysis carried out
